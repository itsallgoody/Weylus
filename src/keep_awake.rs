//! Keep the host's screen on while a client is connected.
//!
//! On Windows an idle desktop turns its display off, and a dark display gives the
//! desktop duplication nothing to capture; if a lock follows, the session cannot be
//! reached at all. Remote-desktop hosts hold a "display required" request while a
//! client is connected, and so does this: the guard lives on the client's own
//! thread, is released when the client leaves, and changes no setting on the machine.
//! Elsewhere it is a no-op.
